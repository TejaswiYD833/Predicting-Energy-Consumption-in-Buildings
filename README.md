# Predicting-Energy-Consumption-in-Buildings with Machine Learning


This project focuses on the development of a **predictive model for energy consumption** in buildings, with an emphasis on incorporating **occupant behavior** and interactions with **indoor environmental control systems** such as lighting and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning). Unlike traditional models that typically focus only on physical building characteristics and external weather conditions, this approach integrates real-time occupant data and system interactions to improve the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting energy consumption in buildings, accounting for the dynamic and often unpredictable behaviors of building occupants. By focusing on these internal factors, the model aims to deliver more accurate energy consumption predictions, which can be used to optimize energy management, reduce consumption, and improve overall building efficiency.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Data on occupant presence and interactions with various building systems (e.g., lighting, HVAC) was collected.
   - The dataset includes information on building occupancy patterns and system usage to better understand energy consumption.

### 2. **Model Development**
   - **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, specifically **Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN)**, were employed to train the predictive model. 
   - The model leverages both environmental data and occupant behaviors to predict energy consumption accurately.

### 3. **Performance Validation**
   - The model's performance is validated using **real-world energy consumption data**, and key evaluation metrics include:
     - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   
   - These metrics provide a thorough evaluation of the modelâ€™s ability to predict energy consumption effectively.

### 4. **Key Findings**
   - Including occupant behavior and system interactions significantly improves the accuracy of energy consumption predictions.
   - This approach presents a more **dynamic, occupant-centric** perspective, which offers more realistic and applicable energy forecasting compared to traditional models that focus solely on external factors.

## Key Contributions

- **Improved Energy Management**: The project highlights the importance of incorporating occupant behavior into energy management strategies, which can reduce energy consumption and enhance occupant comfort.
- **Sustainability**: The findings support the development of **sustainable building practices** by providing tools to better manage and optimize energy usage.
- **Framework for Future Research**: This study lays the foundation for further exploration into occupant-centric energy models and their role in optimizing building performance.

## Potential Applications

This predictive model has several potential applications:
- **Energy Optimization**: Building managers can use the model to optimize energy consumption, thereby reducing operational costs.
- **Smart Building Systems**: The model can be integrated into smart building systems that adjust lighting, HVAC, and other systems based on predicted energy usage.
- **Policy Making**: Policymakers can use the model to design energy efficiency regulations and standards that take into account the behavior of occupants, not just building characteristics.
